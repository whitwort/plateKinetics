#' Analysis of kinetic reads from multiwell plates
#' 
#' This package provides a framework for loading and analyzing data collected in
#' multiwell plate format over time.
#' 
#' A number of vignettes are provided to get you started.  Run 
#' \code{vignette('getting-started')} to see a simple getting started guide. See
#' \code{vignette('design-files')} for a description of the design file format. 
#' See \code{vignette('source-files')} for a description of supported input file
#' formats and loader functions.
#' 
#' If you'd rather not RTFM, jump to \code{\link{loadExperiment}} which load an 
#' experiment object which can be passed to downstream visualization and 
#' analysis functions.
